# CSCI Project, Part 3

In the last week of class, you will present your group project. The project is a
5-10 minute video.  Exactly what is in the video is up to your team.  Feel free
to reach out to Dr. Fasy for feedback and direction if your group needs help
either narrowing down the scope of the project or for feedback on ideas that you
have.

## In-Class Presentation

You will introduce your video, play it, then respond to questions from the
audience (Dr. Fasy and your classmates).  You will be graded on the quality of
the video, the content of the video, and your response to questions.

## Participation in Q&A

As a presenter: be prepared to answer questions about your project! It may help
if you have a rough idea of who will handle which types of questions before you
begin presenting.

As an audience member: You are expected to ask at least one question to each
presenting group.  These can be relating to (re-)explaining a step of an
algorithm or something already presented, asking about connections to other
topics, reasons the group made certain design decisions in their
implementations, or whatever you think is a relevant question.
