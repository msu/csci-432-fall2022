# CSCI Project, Part 1

In today's class (12 September 2022), you will work in a small group to
investigate a problem that can be solved by an algorithm.

By the end of the day tomorrow (13 September 2022), please submit a short
writ-eup that defines the problem (the "WHAT").  Be sure to include proper
references for any external resources that you use.  Don't hesitte to define
variables to make defining the problem more precise (and easier to write down!)
The problem statement should specify what the input and the output of the
solution(s) should be.

Ideas to investigate (but don't limit yourself to these. Feel free to be
creative!):

* matching students to advisers at MSU
* convex hull: given a set of points in the plane, find the smallest convex
  shape that contains all of the points
* voting algorithms
* plagiarism detection
* matrix multiplication

Note: for many of these problems, there exist slight variations that would
result in different "optimal" solutions, as well as multiple algorithms to solve
the same problem.

Update: This write-up should be at least one-page long, and can contain
additional information to help the reader really understand what the problem is.
For example, you might want to include some examples, references/examples where
you would need to use this problem, closely related problems or variants of the
problem, etc. Since this is for the class project, the "WHAT" here should be
more detailed than you would provdie in a standard homework submission.  If you
know of any historical context of the problems, it would be good to include that
as well.  As usual, please cite any external references.  One write-up per
group, submitted in PDF form.
